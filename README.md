# About

This is a chrome extension that translates the language in your web browser into the spoken language of the holo-live vtuber, Usada Pekora (兎田ぺこら).  


# Developers' passion

Have you ever experienced the feeling below?  

>"This website is not funny. I wish I could read it by Pekora's words!!"  
>"Mails from my boss are scary. I wish Pecora was my boss..."  

We were usually feeling that way and that is why we have created this wonderful extension. We hope that you will be happy with this extension.  


# How to use
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./app/views.py
```
And click "LOAD UNPACKED" in the Extensions page.  
After that, you can use it by clicking "Meet ぺこら!"
