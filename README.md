## 🐰About

This is a chrome extension that translates the language(🇯🇵) in your web browser into the spoken language of the holo-live vtuber, Usada Pekora (兎田ぺこら).  


## 🔥Developers' passion

Have you ever felt such feelings before?  

- "This website isn't fun at all. I wish I could read it in Pekora's words!!"  
- "It's really scary to read mails from my boss. I wish Pecora was my boss..."  

We were usually feeling that way and also these kinds of things have happened to you, right?  
That is why we have created this wonderful extension to relieve such feelings by borrowing Pekora's energy.  
We hope that you will be happy with this extension.  


## 🥕How to use
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python ./app/views.py
```
And click "LOAD UNPACKED" in the Extensions page.  
After that, you can use it by clicking "Meet ぺこら!"
